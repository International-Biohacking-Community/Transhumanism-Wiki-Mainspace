==Cryonics is the low-temperature preservation of human beings who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that advancements in future medical technology will enable them to be revived and healed.==

## ==Overview==

==Cryonics uses temperatures below -130°C, often around -196°C, to preserve the human body in a state where decay is significantly slowed. Cryoprotectant agents, similar to antifreeze, are used to minimize freezing damage. The goal of cryonics is to preserve the body's structure, particularly the brain, where memories and personality may be stored, until such time that future advancements in technology, particularly nanotechnology, may allow for revival[1].==

## ==History==

==Cryonics was first proposed in detail in 1962 by Robert Ettinger in his book "The Prospect of Immortality"[2]. The first person to be cryopreserved was Dr. James Bedford in 1967[3]. As of 2021, there are a few companies offering cryonics services, including the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, Cryonics Institute, KrioRus, and Oregon Cryonics[4].==

## ==Procedure==

==The cryopreservation process begins immediately after legal death is declared. The body is cooled and a mechanical device is used to restore circulation and breathing. This is followed by the administration of medications to reduce blood clotting and cellular damage.==

==The body's blood is then replaced with cryoprotective agents in a process called vitrification, which transforms the body tissues into a glass-like state, reducing ice formation. The body is subsequently cooled to the final storage temperature and placed in a storage dewar filled with liquid nitrogen[5].==

## ==Ethical and Legal Considerations==

==Cryonics involves a number of ethical and legal considerations. It raises questions about the definition of death, the disposal of bodies, the rights of the dead, and the impact of the process on family members. It's currently legal in most countries, but the legal status of cryonics can vary. In France, for example, cryonics is explicitly illegal[6].  
==

## ==Controversy and Criticism==

==Many mainstream scientists and doctors are skeptical of cryonics, viewing it as pseudoscience. They question whether it's possible to revive a cryopreserved body and restore its functions, particularly cognitive functions, and some point to the lack of peer-reviewed scientific evidence supporting cryonics[7].==

## ==In Popular Culture==

==Cryonics has been featured in many films, TV shows, books, and video games, often as a method of time travel or life extension. Examples include the movies "Forever Young" and "Demolition Man," and the TV series "Futurama"[8].==
